a. Include a quick summary of how you run your program Scheduler.py

I run my Scheduler.py module by first getting inside the working directory where the script 'Scheduler.py' is saved. Then I type 'python Scheduler.py' in the terminal.

The terminal will then display a welcome message an a list of options to choose from. Type in any valid option and press enter. Then follow the directions given for each option. For instance, press 'a' to add a new user and press enter, then enter a valid username and press enter to add a new user to the scheduler.

In this way, you can perform various actions such as adding, listing, or deleting users. You can also add add, cancel, and reschedule appointments, and even get the purpose for each appointment. 

To exit the program, press 'x' and 'enter' from the main menu.

b. If any of the programs are not working, include what the issue is in you opinion and how you would fix it if you had more time.

After running the program several times I believe that there are no bugs to be fixed.
